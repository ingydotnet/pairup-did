=head1 Description

PairUpâ„¢ is a system for seamlessly putting 2 programmers into a throwaway pair programming environment that is customized for their project and the has the tools they are used to.

The project was started in 2013 here: L<https://github.com/ingydotnet/pairup.>

It used these base tools:

=over

=item * A cheap, throwaway cloud vm (Rackspace, DigitalOcean, etc)

=item * Ubuntu Linux with multiple user accounts

=item * SSH (taking advantage of GitHub publishing keys)

=item * tmux for shared terminal

=item * weechat for IRC in a tmux split window pane

=back

This project is a rewrite (L<https://github.com/ingydotnet/pairup-did)> and uses:

=over

=item * Docker for throwaway containers from virtually anywhere

=item * did for trivial startup (L<https://github.com/ingydotnet/did)>

=item * Ubuntu base Docker image

=item * tmate for simpler SSH, tmux and termcasting

=back

=head1 Installation and Usage

=over

=item Install the C<did> tool

    git clone git@github.com:ingydotnet/did.git
    source $PWD/did/.rc   # Add this line to your shell startup file.

=item Upgrade the C<did> tool

As C<did> is fairly new, it will changing a lot. Use this to stay up to date:

    did upgrade

=item Pull the PairUp Docker image

You will probably want to check for updates regularly:

    docker pull dids/pairup

=item Start a new PairUp session

    did run pairup

=item Start an IRC window?

If you like to use IRC to talk to remote pairs, you can easily start an IRC client in a tmux pane:

    pairup-irc --nick=me^you --server=freenode.net --chan=pairup

For IRC users in a PairUp session, consider using the me^you combination of 2 nicks into 1. It's a "pair" joined by an "up". Get it?!?!

=item Invite someone to PairUp!

Inside the PairUp session, run:

    pairup-info

Use this info to invite a friend to program with you.

=back

=head1 Running on OSX

Since Docker is slightly more complicated to run Docker, it is also slightly more complicated to run PairUp.

You will need a new version of C<docker-machine>. Version 0.5.6 is known to work, but 0.4.1 is known to fail. Get the latest version here: L<https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox>

Run these commands to start your Docker environment:

    docker-machine start default
    eval $(docker-machine env default)

Next do all the steps above in Installation and Usage, but to Start a new PairUp session:

    did run pairup=mac > pairup-mac && bash pairup-mac

This will download a small Bash script and use it to start PairUp. It configures SSH forwarding for you before starting the pairup session.
