= Description

PairUpâ„¢ is a system for seamlessly putting 2 programmers into a throwaway pair
programming environment that is customized for their project and the has the
tools they are used to.

The project was started in 2013 here: https://github.com/ingydotnet/pairup.

It used these base tools:

* A cheap, throwaway cloud vm (Rackspace, DigitalOcean, etc)
* Ubuntu Linux with multiple user accounts
* SSH (taking advantage of GitHub publishing keys)
* tmux for shared terminal
* weechat for IRC in a tmux split window pane

This project is a rewrite (https://github.com/ingydotnet/pairup-did) and uses:

* Docker for throwaway containers from virtually anywhere
* did for trivial startup (https://github.com/ingydotnet/did)
* Ubuntu base Docker image
* tmate for simpler SSH, tmux and termcasting

= Installation and Usage

- Install the `did` tool

    git clone git@github.com:ingydotnet/did.git
    source $PWD/did/.rc   # Add this line to your shell startup file.

- Upgrade the `did` tool

  `did` is fairly new and will be changing a lot. Use this to stay up to date:

    did upgrade

- Pull the PairUp Docker image

  You will probably want to check for updates regularly:

    docker pull dids/pairup

- Read the latest PairUp doc

  The doc you are reading now might be out of date. Read the latest:

    did man pairup

- Start a new PairUp session

    did run pairup

- Start an IRC window?

  If you like to use IRC to talk to remote pairs, you can easily start an IRC
  client in a tmux pane:

    pairup-irc --nick=me^you --server=freenode.net --chan=pairup

  For IRC users in a PairUp session, consider using the me^you combination of
  2 nicks into 1. It's a "pair" joined by an "up". Get it?!?!

- Invite someone to PairUp!

  Inside the PairUp session, run:

    pairup-info

  Use this info to invite a friend to program with you.

= Running on OSX

Since Docker is slightly more complicated to run Docker, it is also slightly
more complicated to run PairUp.

You will need a new version of `docker-machine`. Version 0.5.6 is known to
work, but 0.4.1 is known to fail. Get the latest version here:
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox

Run these commands to start your Docker environment:

  docker-machine start default
  eval $(docker-machine env default)

Next do all the steps above in Installation and Usage, but to Start a new
PairUp session:

  did run pairup=mac > pairup-mac && bash pairup-mac

This will download a small Bash script and use it to start PairUp. It
configures SSH forwarding for you before starting the pairup session.
